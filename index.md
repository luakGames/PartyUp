## Party Up

Party up is a **free to use** discord bot that allows for server members to creative invite tickets to voice channels for specific games. It is useful when users want to join channels that others have reserved for people like them! All code is open source and everything is **free**!

## Adding the bot

To add the PartyUp bot your discord server just [click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=864700118015016991&permissions=8&scope=bot). It will open a link in a new tab where discord will ask you to add the bot to a server of your choice with administator permissions, these are needed for the bot to run and open and close ticket channels when they are opened. Once you add the bot to your server make sure to let everyone know that the bot is in and start using it!

## More about the bot 

Party Up is a discord bot inspired by a channel invite or ticket system I saw was being used on the Valorant discord server. The way the bot works is that server members can create tickets which will open a designated channel with a limited amount of slots open. The ticket channel will close once all members have left the channel and the ticket will be canceled. Basically a channel invite system but for voice channels. To create a ticket the user will run -open and will create a ticket.
